## Attendees:

Andy Troup, aaaa, bbbb, cccc, Adam Buxton, Christopher Lawrence, Keith Apps, Nicholas Moore



## Apologies:



## Items Discussed:

### Andy Troup

Discussed the deprecation of some OS's in the next LTS release

Existing xxx environment only has Win 2016, Win 2019 & RHEL 7

cccc will provide a list of OS from zzzz that the current project will need to run an agent

Puppet Camp Berlin has been cancelled
* This may be of benefit as Puppet Camp is now being run virtually, and thus additional attendees from Customer may be possible.
* Dates & format for rearranged Puppet Camp are unknown

Session with cccc tomorrow to put together the TAM Customer Success Plan

### cccc

All focus on the current project, so not much to report

cccc is soliciting feedback into the enablement/education required within Customer as a result of the on going project

There may be a requirement for a high level Puppet workshop along with the practitioner & getting started courses.
* There is the option for a Bolt workshop
* Customer is happy to host sessions
* There are some unix people already writing code who may need some additional enablement.
* A session for the Apps team may be beneficial.

Keith Apps stated that he has delivered a Puppet Primer session that could be used for Customer.

## Action Items:

* cccc to supply list of operating systems in scope of the implementation project - COMPLETE
* Andy Troup run TAM Customer Success Plan session - COMPLETE
